Vue Essentials

Directives: all starts with 'v-', e.g.:
    v-if -> a "if" statement; likewise, v-else
    v-bind: -> binding a variable to a HTML attribute
    v-for is Vue's iterate statement
    v-on is responsible for event handling

Form implementations in Vue's way:
    v-on:submit is equivalent to action="..."
    v-model="name" to attach a data property to the input value

Modifier for events: v-on:[event].[modifier], e.g.:
    v-on:submit.prevent -> the submit event will no longer reload the page

Filters: {{ [data-property | filter-method] }}
    can be used for display formatting.

Mounted: a part of a Vue instance lifecycle:
    mount the instance to the DOM,
    update the DOM when data changes
    mounted functions will be called after the instance has been mounted.

Transitions: The transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM.
    Used with v-if, v-show, etc.
    1. <transition></transition> in HTML, then Vue will see whether has CSS transitions or
    animations applied. If it does, use them.
    2. In CSS, four classes applied are: v-enter, v-enter-active, v-leave, v-leave-active
    3. If <transition> has a "name" attr, the "v" in the class names is replaced with the
    name value.
    E.g.:
    HTML -- <transition name="fade"> </transition>
    CSS -- .fade-enter-active {
               transition: opacity .5s
           }
           .fade-enter, .fade-leave-active {
               opacity: 0
           }

Transition Group: It's used for a list, while transition is used for a single element.
    With "tag" attr, it can customize a tag to render.
    HTML -  <transition-group tag="ul">  <!-- will be treated as ul in the browser -->
                <li v-for="item in cart"></li>
            </transition-group>


List Rendering: to identify each item in the list, bind a unique key with v-bind:key
    id is an ideal key to bind.
    It's recommended to provide a key with v-for whenever possible.

Computed properties: computed variables, use functions to compute a property with existing properties
    Can be bind to html after v-if, ...
