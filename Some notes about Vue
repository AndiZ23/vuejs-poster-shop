Directives: all starts with 'v-', e.g.:
    v-if -> a "if" statement; likewise, v-else
    v-bind: -> binding a variable to a HTML attribute
    v-for is Vue's iterate statement
    v-on is responsible for event handling

Form implementations in Vue's way:
    v-on:submit is equivalent to action="..."
    v-model="name" to attach a data property to the input value

Modifier for events: v-on:[event].[modifier], e.g.:
    v-on:submit.prevent -> the submit event will no longer reload the page

Filters: {{ [data-property | filter-method] }}
    can be used for display formatting.

Mounted: a part of a Vue instance lifecycle:
    mount the instance to the DOM,
    update the DOM when data changes
    mounted functions will be called after the instance has been mounted.
